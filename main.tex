% About the client.


% About the project.
An important and basic skill that all students must be equipped with is a strong command over the Microsoft Office utilities â€“ whether they are looking for higher educational opportunities or jobs. As part of our workshop, we intend on working with Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel amongst our students such that they may use these utilities in the most proficient manner and showcase these skills with freedom in class activities.

% About the plan of work.
We will conduct 4 hours session each day. For the 1st hour, we will be giving theoretical lecture. In the 2nd hour, we will be giving a demo on our computers, and for the remaining two hours the students will be having hands-on experience and practicing on computer by themselves.

\section*{Conclusion}

% Remind the reader about the project. Summarise your activities over the course of the project.
By the end of our project with the students of \textbf{Fixit} School, we were able to familiarize them with the three most important Microsoft Office utilities and Microsoft Paint. However, since students had little to no experience of using Computers, we had a very difficult task ahead of us, for e.g. It took a lot of time for students to understand the Keyboard Layout itself.\\
Even so, we were extremely pleased to see the development in a lot of students by the end of the workshop. The students were keen to learn and gain hands-on experience and we had managed to complete our revised Sylalbus - adjusted by the comfort level of each group - on time.
